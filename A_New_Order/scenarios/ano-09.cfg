They hated me, because I tried to be independent. And maybe they hated me because I was reminding them how I became wife of Gawen's father: how I became a queen."

I took soldiers Reme gave me for my protection and I rode east. I knew people there, who could help me. Akladians would not fight for me, I was sure of that; So I had to find someone else who would.

They were not race, though in past times their ancestors came here from distant lands. Now, they accepted everyone into their ranks. I've heard that even some Akladians found their place amongst them."

In last battle, when all other Wesnothians were running for their life, Aragwaithi stood and fell to the last one. That's why we cutted their head off, their hands and legs, so in after life they could not be danger for us."

            story=_"I found one of their sietches and talked to their leader, called Andrey Yaranov. I wanted swords, and I had gold; they had swords and wanted gold. So we struck the deal very fast. I felt uneasy amongst them, with their eyes, hair, faces screaming that they are underlings. But I told myself they are just swords; hired swords."
