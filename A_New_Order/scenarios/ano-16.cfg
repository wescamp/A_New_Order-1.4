            story=_"Finally, I was confident that my troops are ready for the task which awaited me. When I told Gwidle about that, he insisted on having farewell feast. There was wine, food and nice music. There were also finest dancers from Freetown girls and women, doing some kind of traditional folk-dance in special costumes with masks and shawls."

            story=_"Soon we all were a little bit drunk. From my right Karen was commenting dancer's faults and saying how she would be much better, and even how much her dancer's costume was better. From my left I've heard Andrey Yaranov trying to seduce my step-mother, the harder the more he was drunk, while Lorin was ignoring him and babbling about something oracle told her in her youth."

            story=_"Karen was the first who left the chamber, and Lorin went immediately after her. Of course Yaranov jauntly followed her. I drink with Ruvio, without much talking, and when I decided I had enough I went to my bedroom."

            story=_"I am not sure when she came to me, deprived of shame and clothes. She entered my chamber so quietly that in first moment I thought it was a dream. I was too drunk to ask any questions. I was too drunk to oppose her when she slipped into my bed."

            story=_"Who was she? She was in dancer's mask, but somehow I doubt she was one of dancers I saw few hours earlier. There was something familiar in the way she moved, breathed and gasped. Maybe if I would be sober I would recognise her even with mask. But I wasn't, and I didn't care."
