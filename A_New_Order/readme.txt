Known problems:
*Sometimes after downloading the campaign, some of the images are not shown correctly. Before reporting a bug to me, try quit the wesnoth program completely and then start it again. If this won't help, contact me.

If you think I should credit someone here, post me a message.

Many of the Akladian faction sprites were corrected by Wayfarer.

Many thanks to ott for hinting how to fix campaign to be post 0.9.3 compatible.
